          <li>Declarations contain two important components:

                        The value of the property</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript here:</li>
          <li>To declare a variable use the keyword 'var'</li>
          <li>'=' is an assignment operator used to assign specific data to store in a variable</li>
          <li>Press Cmd+Opt+I to open the Chrome DevTools or right click the webpage and select inspect</li>
          <li>JavaScript links are located at the bottom of the HTML file, under the footer but above the closing element for the body</li>
          <li>When a computer encounters an 'if' statement in a JavaScript file it will check to see if it is truthy, then do the action between the {}, then break out of the 'if' statement</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator '===' checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data between []. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>All lines of code must finsh with ';'</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li> Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional 'if' statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times</li>
          <li>The array length is important because the 'for' loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named 'length'</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop contains three important statements, the starting point for the loop, the condition, the indices</li>
          <li>The code 'x++'' is a shortcut way of writing 'x+1'. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
          <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
